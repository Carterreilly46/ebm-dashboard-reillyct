**The Hypothesis:** When executives communicate frequently during organizational changes, employees maintain clearer understanding of their roles, which helps the organization maintain productivity levels during disruption.

**Why This Matters:** If true, this means communication isn't just "nice to have" - it's a direct lever for protecting organizational performance during change.

## 🔍 Dataset Discovery Process

### The Challenge
We needed organizational data that measures all three variables (communication, role clarity, productivity) across many organizations over time. Most organizational datasets only capture outcomes (productivity, turnover) but miss the human experience (communication, clarity). Where could we find this?

### The Discovery Journey

**Initial Research Question:** "Find professional datasets measuring employee communication satisfaction and role clarity during organizational changes with productivity outcomes"

**Data Sources Evaluated:**
1. ✅ **Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS)** - U.S. OPM ⭐ SELECTED
2. ❌ Gallup Workplace Studies - Proprietary, expensive, limited public access
3. ❌ LinkedIn Workforce Data - No communication or role clarity measures
4. ❌ Indeed Job Satisfaction - Measures satisfaction but not organizational change
5. ✅ **BLS Productivity Data** - Bureau of Labor Statistics ⭐ SELECTED (supplement)
6. ✅ **BLS JOLTS Turnover** - Bureau of Labor Statistics ⭐ SELECTED (supplement)

**Why FEVS Won:**
- **Unique Triple Coverage:** Only dataset measuring X (communication satisfaction), M (role clarity), and Y proxies (engagement) in single survey
- **Massive Scale:** 600,000+ federal employees respond annually - statistically powerful
- **Long History:** 2002-present with consistent questions since 2010 - can track organizational changes over time
- **Professional Quality:** Administered by independent federal agency (OPM), not individual organizations - reduces manipulation concerns
- **Free & Public:** No cost, no approval needed for aggregate data - accessible to everyone
- **Real Organizations:** Tracks actual federal agencies through real restructuring, mergers, budget cuts, leadership transitions

**Coverage:** 2002-present (22+ years) | 600,000-700,000 respondents per year  
**Data Format:** Excel, CSV downloads | Agency-level aggregates  

**What We Get From FEVS:**
- **X Variable (Communication):** Items 53, 58, 61, 64 measuring management communication satisfaction
  - *Example: "How satisfied are you with information from management?"*
  - **Current Baseline: 58% satisfied** (down from 65% pre-COVID)

- **M Variable (Role Clarity):** Items 4, 6, 11, 13 measuring job expectations understanding
  - *Example: "I know what is expected of me on the job"*
  - **Current Baseline: 78% agree** (down from 82% pre-COVID)

- **Y Variable (Productivity Proxy):** Employee Engagement Index, workload management items
  - *Composite of satisfaction, commitment, pride items*
  - **Current Baseline: 65% positive** (down from 69% pre-COVID)

### Supplementary Source 1: BLS Productivity Data

**Repository:** Bureau of Labor Statistics - Major Sector Productivity  
**Access URL:** https://www.bls.gov/lpc/  
**Series Code:** PRS88003092 (Federal Government Output Per Hour)  
**Cost:** FREE - Publicly available  
**Update Frequency:** Quarterly with revisions  
**Coverage:** 1947-present (75+ years of productivity tracking)  

**What We Get:**
- **Objective Productivity:** Output per hour worked (current: Index 98.2, base 2012=100)
- **Validates FEVS:** Checks whether employee perceptions match actual productivity trends
- **Temporal Resolution:** Quarterly data provides better timing than annual FEVS

### Supplementary Source 2: BLS JOLTS Turnover

**Repository:** Bureau of Labor Statistics - Job Openings & Labor Turnover Survey  
**Access URL:** https://www.bls.gov/jlt/  
**Cost:** FREE - Publicly available  
**Update Frequency:** Monthly with 1-month lag  
**Coverage:** 2000-present (24+ years)  

**What We Get:**
- **Voluntary Turnover:** Quits as proxy for employee dissatisfaction/confusion
- **Current Baseline:** 7-9% annual turnover (spikes to 10-14% during organizational changes)
- **Behavioral Validation:** If communication/clarity problems exist, people leave

## 📥 Data Collection Plan

### What We're Measuring

**Communication Frequency (X):**
- FEVS Item 64: "How satisfied are you with information from management?"
- FEVS Items 53, 58, 61: Senior leader communication, supervisor communication, organizational transparency
- **Measurement:** 5-point Likert scale (1=Very Dissatisfied, 5=Very Satisfied)
- **Analysis:** % responding 4-5 (satisfied/very satisfied)

**Role Clarity (M):**
- FEVS Item 4: "I know what is expected of me on the job"
- FEVS Item 6: "I know how my work relates to the agency's goals"
- **Measurement:** 5-point Likert scale (1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree)
- **Analysis:** % responding 4-5 (agree/strongly agree)

**Productivity Maintenance (Y):**
- BLS Productivity Index: Federal government output per hour worked
- FEVS Engagement Index: Composite employee engagement score
- BLS JOLTS: Voluntary quit rate
- **Analysis:** Track changes during organizational transitions vs. stable periods

### Time Periods

**Study Window:** 2010-2024 (14 years)  
**Baseline Period:** 2019 (pre-COVID stable operations)  
**Comparison:** Agencies during change vs. stable agencies  
**Trend Analysis:** 5-year rolling windows to detect patterns

## 🔓 Access & Permissions

**FEVS Data:**
- ✅ Public access, no permissions required
- ✅ Download directly from OPM website
- ✅ Agency-level aggregates ready to use
- ⚠️ Individual-level microdata requires OPM approval (not needed for this project)

**BLS Data:**
- ✅ Public access, no permissions required
- ✅ Download via BLS website or API
- ✅ Full historical series available

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Using only aggregate data (no individual employees identified)
- No insider access needed (all public sources)
- Reporting only patterns, not naming specific troubled agencies

## 🎲 Analysis Approach

### Testing the X→M→Y Pathway

**Step 1: Establish Baselines**
- 2019 pre-COVID scores as "normal operations" benchmark
- Government-wide averages as comparison points

**Step 2: Identify Organizational Changes**
- Use GAO reports, agency announcements to identify major transitions (mergers, restructurings, budget cuts)
- Map FEVS survey years to organizational change timelines

**Step 3: Compare Communication Levels**
- High communication agencies vs. low communication agencies
- Same agency before vs. during vs. after organizational change

**Step 4: Test Mediation**
- Does role clarity (M) explain the relationship between communication (X) and productivity (Y)?
- Statistical mediation analysis using multi-year data

**Step 5: Control for Confounds**
- Agency size, budget changes, leadership transitions, economic conditions
- Within-agency comparisons to control for stable characteristics

### What Success Looks Like

If our hypothesis is correct, we should see:
- ✅ Communication drops 10-15 points during organizational changes
- ✅ Role clarity drops 8-12 points when communication declines
- ✅ Productivity/engagement drops 5-20% when role clarity declines
- ✅ Pattern holds across multiple agencies and time periods
- ✅ Agencies maintaining communication maintain better role clarity and productivity

## 💪 Why This Data Works

**Strengths:**
- 600,000+ respondents annually = statistical power
- 14-year history = can track real organizational changes
- Professional collection = high quality standards
- Multiple sources = cross-validation possible
- Free access = anyone can verify our findings

**Limitations (Acknowledged):**
- Annual frequency misses real-time dynamics
- Self-reported perceptions not objective communication counts
- Federal context may not generalize to private sector
- Cannot establish definitive causation (observational design)

**Bottom Line:** This data won't give us perfect answers, but it's the best available evidence for understanding communication-role clarity-productivity relationships during real organizational changes. Combined with scientific literature, practitioner expertise, and stakeholder input, it provides a solid foundation for evidence-based decision-making.

**Next Step:** Use this data to populate `evidence-organizational-sources.txt` with actual findings, then critically appraise limitations in `evidence-organizational-appraisal.txt` using Peterson's 10 Barriers framework.
