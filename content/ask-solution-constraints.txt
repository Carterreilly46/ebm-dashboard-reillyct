- Misinterpretation of incomplete information
- Over-promising and under-delivering on commitments

### Operational Risks
- Communication activities cannot disrupt critical operations
- Must maintain business continuity during transitions

### Change Management Risks
- Resistance from executives who prefer less transparency
- Middle manager anxiety about answering difficult questions
