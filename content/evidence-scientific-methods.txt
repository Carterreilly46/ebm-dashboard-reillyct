# 🎯 THREE STUDIES SELECTED

---

## **STUDY #1: Meta-Analysis of Role Clarity & Performance**

**Full Citation:**  
Tubre, T. C., & Collins, J. M. (2000). Jackson and Schuler (1985) revisited: A meta-analysis of the relationships between role ambiguity, role conflict, and job performance. *Journal of Management, 26*(1), 155-169. https://doi.org/10.1177/014920630002600104

**Study Type:** Systematic review / meta-analysis  
**Sample:** 169 studies, 35,265 employees across industries  
**Journal Quality:** *Journal of Management* (Impact Factor: 11.2, Top-tier)  
**Citations:** 1,400+ (highly influential)

### 📊 **CAT MANAGER CRITICAL APPRAISAL:**

| **Criterion** | **Rating** |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Design Quality** | **Level A - Highly Appropriate** for causal inference |
| **Effect Size** | Medium (ρ = .30) |
| **Precision** | Good (narrow confidence intervals) |
| **Weaknesses** | ⚠️ Likely missed some studies (publication bias) |
| **TRUSTWORTHINESS** | **HIGH (90%)** |

**Interpretation:** 10% chance alternative explanations exist. Meta-analysis provides strongest aggregate evidence.

### 🔑 **Key Finding:**
**ρ = -.30** (role ambiguity → lower performance)  
**= r = +.30** (role clarity → higher performance)

**What this means:** Clear role expectations explain 9% of performance variance. For every 1-point increase in role clarity, performance improves by 0.30 standard deviations.

### ✅ **Why Selected:**
- Highest level of evidence (aggregates 169 studies)
- Directly tests **M→Y pathway** (role clarity → productivity)
- Corrects for measurement error (ρ statistic)
- Cross-industry generalizability

## **STUDY #2: Leadership Communication Survey**

**Full Citation:**  
Men, L. R. (2014). Why leadership matters to internal communication: Linking transformational leadership, symmetrical communication, and employee outcomes. *Public Relations Review, 40*(4), 575-584. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubrev.2014.06.012

**Study Type:** Cross-sectional survey with structural equation modeling  
**Sample:** 326 employees across multiple US organizations  
**Journal Quality:** *Public Relations Review* (Peer-reviewed)

### 📊 **CAT MANAGER CRITICAL APPRAISAL:**

| **Criterion** | **Rating** |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Design Quality** | **Level D - Not Appropriate** for causal claims |
| **Effect Size** | Medium (β = .38 - .41) |
| **Precision** | Good (adequate sample for SEM) |
| **Weaknesses** | ⚠️ Non-random sampling, cross-sectional design |
| **TRUSTWORTHINESS** | **LOW (60%)** |

**Interpretation:** 40% chance alternative explanations exist. Good for relationships, weak for causation.

### 🔑 **Key Findings:**
- **β = .41** (leadership communication → employee-organization relationships)
- **β = .38** (symmetrical communication → organizational commitment)
- **R² = .32** (communication explains 32% outcome variance)

**What this means:** Two-way communication between leaders and employees predicts employee commitment and relationship quality at medium-to-large levels.

### ✅ **Why Selected:**
- Tests **full X→M→Y model** in one study
- Direct measurement of communication transparency
- Multiple organizations sampled
- Despite design limitations, shows consistent pattern with other studies

## **STUDY #3: Merger Communication Field Experiment**

**Full Citation:**  
Schweiger, D. M., & DeNisi, A. S. (1991). Communication with employees following a merger: A longitudinal field experiment. *Academy of Management Journal, 34*(1), 110-135. https://doi.org/10.5465/256304

**Study Type:** Non-randomized controlled field experiment (quasi-experimental)  
**Sample:** ~200 employees in two manufacturing plants during merger  
**Journal Quality:** *Academy of Management Journal* (Top-tier, Impact Factor: 9.5)  
**Citations:** 2,900+ (foundational/classic study)

### 📊 **CAT MANAGER CRITICAL APPRAISAL:**

| **Criterion** | **Rating** |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Design Quality** | **Level B - Moderately Appropriate** for causal inference |
| **Effect Size** | Medium (d = 0.47) |
| **Precision** | Too wide (moderate confidence intervals) |
| **Weaknesses** | ✅ No serious weaknesses identified |
| **TRUSTWORTHINESS** | **MODERATE (80%)** |

**Interpretation:** 20% chance alternative explanations exist. Strong causal design with control group.

### 🔑 **Key Findings:**
- **d = 0.47** (communication intervention → reduced role ambiguity)
- **d = 0.39** (communication intervention → improved job satisfaction)
- **Effects sustained at 5-month follow-up**

**What this means:** Enhanced communication during organizational change reduced employee confusion about roles by nearly half a standard deviation compared to standard communication. Effect lasted over time.

### ✅ **Why Selected:**
- **Strongest causal design** (intervention vs. control)
- **Organizational change context** (directly relevant to our problem)
- Longitudinal tracking (4 time points over 5 months)
- Tests **X→M pathway** (communication → role clarity)
