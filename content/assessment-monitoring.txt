# 📊 Assessment: Proving It Actually Works
## How We'll Know If Communication → Clarity → Productivity Is Real

---

## 🎯 THE BIG QUESTIONS

**We're about to invest $120K-150K. Before we do, let's define success:**

1. Did executives actually communicate consistently? (Implementation check)
2. Did role clarity improve? (Mechanism check)
3. Did productivity increase? (Outcome check)
4. Where did it work best/worst? (Learning check)

**Evaluation Approach:** Quasi-experimental design with comparison groups + time-series tracking

---

## � EVALUATION DESIGN: Treatment vs. Comparison Groups

### Why This Approach?

**Ideal:** Randomized controlled trial (RCT)  
**Reality:** Can't randomly assign communication in one organization  
**Solution:** Quasi-experimental design with matched comparison group

This lets us rule out alternative explanations (economy, seasonality, etc.)

---

### The Setup

| Aspect | Treatment Group | Comparison Group |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Who** | Division A (200-300 employees) | Division B (similar size/function) |
| **Gets Intervention?** | ✅ YES (weekly/monthly comms) | ❌ NO (standard quarterly updates) |
| **Gets Measured?** | ✅ YES (quarterly surveys) | ✅ YES (same surveys - controls for measurement effects) |
| **Timeline** | Enhanced comms start Month 2 | Standard comms continue through Month 12 |

**Key:** Groups are **matched** on:
- Similar department functions
- Similar team sizes
- Similar baseline clarity scores
- Similar baseline productivity
- Similar manager experience

**After Month 12:** Comparison group gets the intervention (ethical + replication test)

---

### 📅 Measurement Timeline

```
Month 0:  📊 BASELINE (both groups measure starting point)

## 📋 HOW WE'LL MEASURE

### 1️⃣ Role Clarity Survey (Quarterly, 5 questions, 5-point scale)

**The Questions:**
1. "I clearly understand my job responsibilities and what is expected of me"
2. "I know how my work contributes to our organization's overall goals"
3. "I have clear priorities this quarter and know what success looks like"
4. "I receive sufficient information from leadership to do my job effectively"
5. "I understand how recent leadership decisions affect my team"

**Logistics:**
- Email link, 10 minutes to complete
- Anonymous (for honesty) but collect demographics (division, role, tenure)
- Target: 80% response rate
- Analysis: Compare treatment vs. comparison group at each time point

### 2️⃣ Productivity Metrics (Monthly)

**Choose 2-3 most relevant for your organization:**
- **Project Completion:** % completed on time/budget
- **Quality:** Error rates, customer satisfaction, rework frequency
- **Output:** Units produced, sales closed, tickets resolved
- **Efficiency:** Cycle time, time-to-completion

**Data Source:** Existing systems (project mgmt software, CRM, quality dashboards)  
**Analysis:** Track trends, compare treatment vs. comparison groups

### 3️⃣ Communication Fidelity Tracking (Weekly)

**What We Track:**
- Did weekly all-hands happen? (Yes/No)
- Did monthly town hall happen? (Yes/No)
- Did managers cascade within 24 hours? (% compliance)
- Were scorecards completed? (% completion)

**Why This Matters:** Distinguishes "intervention didn't work" from "intervention wasn't done properly"

### 4️⃣ Qualitative Feedback (Ongoing)

- **Anonymous Q&A Portal:** What questions are employees asking?
- **Focus Groups:** Month 6 - what's working? what's not?
- **Manager Interviews:** Month 6 - barriers? successes?
- **Exec Reflections:** Month 12 - lessons learned?

**Purpose:** Understand HOW and WHY it's working (or not)

---
- Anonymous (to encourage honesty) but demographic data collected (division, role level, tenure) for subgroup analysis
- Target response rate: 80%

**Analysis:**
- Calculate mean role clarity score (average of 5 items)
- Compare treatment vs. comparison group at each time point
- Track change over time within each group
- Effect size: Cohen's d for group differences

#### **2. Productivity Metrics (Monthly)**

**Metrics Tracked (choose 2-3 most relevant for your organization):**
- **Project Completion Rate:** % of projects completed on time and within budget
- **Quality Metrics:** Error/defect rates, customer satisfaction scores, rework frequency
- **Output Metrics:** Units produced, sales closed, support tickets resolved
- **Efficiency Metrics:** Cycle time, time-to-completion, process speed

**Data Source:**
- Existing organizational systems (project management software, CRM, quality dashboards)
- Aggregated at team level (to protect individual privacy)
- Baseline established from 6 months pre-intervention

**Analysis:**
- Calculate month-over-month change for each metric
- Compare treatment vs. comparison group trends
---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION FIDELITY: Are We Actually Doing This Right?

**Critical Question:** If it doesn't work, why not?
- **Option A:** The theory is wrong (communication doesn't improve clarity/productivity)
- **Option B:** We screwed up the implementation (didn't do it properly)

Only high-fidelity implementation lets us test the theory fairly.

---

### 📝 Fidelity Check #1: CONTENT

**Did we communicate the RIGHT things?**

**Required Content (from evidence):**
- ✅ Strategic context ("Why this decision?")
- ✅ Role implications ("How does this affect MY team?")
- ✅ Priorities ("What should we focus on?")
- ✅ Transparency ("What are we struggling with?")
- ✅ Q&A (address employee concerns)

**How We Measure:**
- Review 25% random sample of communications
- Score each 0-5 on content requirements
- **Target:** ≥4.0 average (80% of requirements met)

**What We Do:**
- Communication coordinator reviews monthly
- Provides feedback to executives
- Adjusts templates/training as needed

---

### 🎯 Fidelity Check #2: DOSE

**Did we communicate OFTEN enough?**

**Required Frequency:**
- ✅ Weekly all-hands: 48/year (92%)
- ✅ Monthly town halls: 11/year (92%)
- ✅ Manager cascade: 90% within 24 hours
- ✅ Scorecards: 95% completion quarterly

**How We Measure:**
- Automated event tracking log
- **Target:** ≥90% of planned events happen

**What We Do:**
- Track completion weekly
- Escalate if consistency drops below 85%
- Identify/remove barriers

---

### 💎 Fidelity Check #3: QUALITY

**Was communication CLEAR and ACTIONABLE?**

**Required Quality:**
- ✅ Specific, not vague ("Reduce cycle time by 10%" not "Improve productivity")
- ✅ Relevant to employees' actual work
- ✅ Interactive, not one-way broadcasts

**How We Measure:**
Employee surveys (quarterly):
- "Leadership communication is clear and easy to understand"
- "Leadership communication is relevant to my work"
- "I feel comfortable asking questions"
- **Target:** ≥3.5 on all three (5-point scale) by Month 6

**What We Do:**
- Review results quarterly
- Coach executives with lower scores
- Share/celebrate high-quality examples

---

### 🔍 Fidelity Check #4: DIFFERENTIATION

**Is treatment group getting something DIFFERENT from comparison group?**

**Expectation:**
Treatment group should score ≥1.0 point higher than comparison group on:
- "I receive frequent updates from leadership"
- "Leadership communication helps me understand my role"

**If NOT different:**
- Intervention isn't differentiated enough
- Action: Increase intensity or improve quality

---

## � ANALYSIS PLAN: Testing the Pathway

### Hypothesis 1: Communication → Role Clarity (X → M)

**Test:** Compare treatment vs. comparison group at Month 6

| Metric | Treatment Group | Comparison Group | Difference |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| Clarity Score | [Target: ≥3.5] | [Expected: ~3.0] | ≥0.5 points |
| Effect Size | - | - | Cohen's d ≥0.30 |

**Success:** p < .05 AND d ≥ .30  
**Translation:** Communication improves clarity ✅

---

### Hypothesis 2: Role Clarity → Productivity (M → Y)

**Test:** Within treatment group, correlate clarity scores with productivity

| Analysis | Expected Result |
|----------|----------------|
| Correlation | r ≥ .25-.30 |
| Regression | β ≥ .30, p < .05 |

**Success:** Significant positive relationship  
**Translation:** Clarity drives productivity ✅

---

### Hypothesis 3: The Full Pathway (X → M → Y)

**Test:** Mediation analysis

```
Communication → Role Clarity → Productivity
    (Path A)       (Path B)        (Total Effect)
```

**Expected:**
- Path A significant (communication improves clarity)
- Path B significant (clarity improves productivity)
- Indirect effect (A × B) significant

**Success:** Mediation confirmed  
**Translation:** Communication boosts productivity THROUGH clarity ✅

---

**Decision Rule:**
- If **full or partial mediation confirmed**: ✅ Theory validated → Communication works BECAUSE it improves clarity
- If **no mediation**: ❌ Theory wrong → Communication might affect productivity through OTHER mechanisms (or not at all)

---

### Secondary Analyses: Moderators & Boundary Conditions

**Question:** Where does the intervention work best/worst?

**Moderator Analyses:**
1. **Team Size:** Does intervention work better in small vs. large teams?
2. **Manager Experience:** Do veteran managers cascade more effectively than new managers?
3. **Baseline Clarity:** Do employees with LOW baseline clarity benefit more?
4. **Role Type:** Do front-line vs. managerial employees respond differently?

**Method:** Regression with interaction terms (e.g., Communication × Team Size → Productivity)

**Purpose:** Identify conditions for success → refine future implementation

---

## 🚨 EARLY WARNING SYSTEM

### When to Sound the Alarm?

**Red Flags at Month 3 (Short-Term Check):**
- [ ] **Fidelity <80%:** Executives missing scheduled communication events
- [ ] **Quality scores <3.0:** Employees rate communication as unclear/unhelpful
- [ ] **No clarity improvement:** Treatment group role clarity unchanged from baseline
- [ ] **Negative feedback:** Focus groups reveal frustration with "more meetings, no substance"

**Action if Red Flags:** PAUSE, diagnose problem, adjust intervention (e.g., better training, reduce frequency, improve content)

---

**Red Flags at Month 6 (Medium-Term Check):**
- [ ] **Clarity gap <0.3 points:** Treatment and comparison groups not meaningfully different
- [ ] **Engagement declining:** Survey scores dropping, not improving
- [ ] **Productivity flat:** No positive trends in productivity metrics

**Action if Red Flags:** Conduct thorough evaluation, consider major redesign or discontinuation

---

**Green Lights (Keep Going):**
- ✅ High implementation fidelity (>90%)
- ✅ Role clarity improving in treatment group (≥0.5 point increase)
- ✅ Early productivity trends positive (+5-10%)
- ✅ Employee feedback mostly positive

**Action:** Continue implementation, expand to additional groups
